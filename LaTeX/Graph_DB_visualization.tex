\begin{abstract}
	Much evolutionary computation research collects and reports thin statistical
	summaries that fail to capture or convey the complex dynamics of our
	actual runs, and all their micro-level events. In principle, however, we control
	every moment in our evolutionary runs and could record all these events.
	This would, for example, allow us to build full ancestry trees, identifying and analyzing the key events that led to success in a run, or blocked it. Here we
	illustrate the use of graph databases to collect rich details from genetic programming runs, and then describe information rich visualizations designed to aid in the understanding of these large, complex data sets.
	These visualizations have been key in discovering surprising and significant
	events in our runs, leading to new understanding of the dynamics of our
	evolutionary systems.

\section{Outline}
\marginpar{Obviously this has to go away.}

My general idea for the outline:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduction: Rant about throwing away all that data and talk about why that's a bummer. This will actually probably be pretty long, maybe long enough that it should be a separate section?
	\item Graph Databases: Describe the basic idea, and our particular (current) data schema (include the semantics).
	\item Visualizations: Describe different edges, boxes sizes and shapes, colors (even though they won't display here)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Full runs
		\item Just ancestors
		\item Filtered by genes
	\end{enumerate}
	\item What have we learned? Hyperselection. Semantics hyperselection. Use the end of the poster run to illustrate both of these features.
	\item Conclusions: Graph DBs make this work possible and more people should do it. Does suck up a lot of disk space and takes a while, though, so there's work to be done. Need to get better at automating processes and combining analysis across multiple runs.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Your text comes here. Separate text sections with
\section{Section title}
\label{sec:1}
Text with citations \cite{RefB} and \cite{RefJ}.
\subsection{Subsection title}
\label{sec:2}
as required. Don't forget to give each section
and subsection a unique label (see Sect.~\ref{sec:1}).
\paragraph{Paragraph headings} Use paragraph headings as needed.
\begin{equation}
a^2+b^2=c^2
\end{equation}

% For one-column wide figures use
\begin{figure}
% Use the relevant command to insert your figure file.
% For example, with the graphicx package use
  \includegraphics{example.eps}
% figure caption is below the figure
\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
\label{fig:1}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}
%
% For two-column wide figures use
\begin{figure*}
% Use the relevant command to insert your figure file.
% For example, with the graphicx package use
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{example.eps}
% figure caption is below the figure
\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
\label{fig:2}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure*}
%
% For tables use
\begin{table}
% table caption is above the table
\caption{Please write your table caption here}
\label{tab:1}       % Give a unique label
% For LaTeX tables use
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
first & second & third  \\
\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
number & number & number \\
number & number & number \\
\noalign{\smallskip}\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
